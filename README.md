### Multiple mounts

The problems is that nested navigation yields to screens being mounted twice. In a complicated expo @ expo-router setup this leads to broken analyitcs, multiple network requests and degraded performance.

I've create two examples of navigating from the root screen to either nested tab or nested screen (within different Stack).
